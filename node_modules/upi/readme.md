# UPI - Universal Package Installer

Upi is a wrapper for existing package managers
to provide a language agnostic and universal interface for managing packages.

Of course I have to refer to the corresponding xkcd 1654:

However, as you can see from the date of my first commit,
I had the idea first!
The xkcd was posted on 2016-03-11 and my first commit was on 2015-02-07. =P
